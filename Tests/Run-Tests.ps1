.SYNOPSIS
    Runs every test set beside it and reports which of them failed.

.DESCRIPTION
    Five sets, each answering a different question, none of them starting the
    game:

      - `Check-Mod.ps1`          - does TailorMade still look the way the
                                   patches assume? Reflection over its
                                   assembly; no code of ours is run.
      - `Check-Logic.ps1`        - given the settings, does our own code hand
                                   back the right band and shorten the right
                                   garments? Our patch bodies are invoked.
      - `Check-Settings.ps1`     - defaults, reset, and the clamping applied to
                                   a config file that has been hand-edited.
      - `Check-Trousers.ps1`     - does the code that draws trouser details
                                   onto a plain shell keep to its rules, on
                                   synthetic shells and on AB's real ones?
                                   Pure bytes; no Unity, no game.
      - `Check-Localization.ps1` - every player-facing key resolves in English
                                   and French, and the hidden shortcut is
                                   declared as asked.

    What still needs a running colony is in `TESTING.md`, and nothing here
    replaces it.

    The sets do not all take the same parameters - `Check-Localization.ps1`
    reads the tree rather than the assemblies, and `Check-Settings.ps1` wants
    Harmony as a folder where the others want the DLL. So each one is given
    only the parameters it declares, in the shape its own default shows it
    expects.

    Exit code is 0 when all pass, 1 when a check failed, 2 when a set could
    not run at all - a missing game or Workshop path, most likely.
