licence_at:   "MIT, chosen 2026-09-20 (LICENSE at the root and in Mod/), matching TailorMade, which is MIT. Nothing is copied from it: it is referenced at build time and patched through Harmony. Mod/ is publishable: one assembly of our own, patching TailorMade, which is MIT. Parked/ is not, and never ships - its textures are computed from General Textures Collection (3789119336) and WDI's Realistic Bodies (3527486510), neither of which grants a licence. Steam uploads Mod/ only, which is the safeguard, and Parked/, Art/ and the GIMP projects are kept out of the public repository by .gitignore. See ATTRIBUTION.md."
dependencies: "brrainz.harmony and astryl.tailormade, both required. A mod that gives leg garments a worn graphic at all, since vanilla trousers carry none - tested with AB.VPLRF. A body retexture drawn without legs is the reason the mod exists, tested with wdi.realistic.bodies, but nothing in the code names it."

Local sources in Art/ (ignored by git): Preview.png and ModIcon-source.png, the untouched illustrations; preview.html, preview-palette.json and render-preview.cjs compose the Preview; make-icon.cjs cuts the icon; preview-qa.json holds the measurements
tested_on:
workshop:     "3806769245, prepublished 2026-09-23 by her. Private, as Steam creates every item and RimWorld never calls SetItemVisibility. Mod/About/PublishedFileId.txt is committed (18e2bf2); losing it would make the next upload a second item. The description was sent with the item and is not resent on an update - a correction now happens on the Steam page by hand."
automated_tests: "Five sets through Tests/Run-Tests.ps1, all re-run 2026-09-23 at 21:25 on the rebuilt DLL (SHA-256 7FD0FEBF...59C5, built 21:21; the 2026-09-21 build was F624927E...5271) and all green: Check-Mod 30/30 (TailorMade still looks the way the patches assume), Check-Logic 48/48 (our own patch bodies: the band per slider, the classes left whole, the fallback's recognition tolerance, which garments the shirt option lifts, which garments TailorMade is told to leave alone), Check-Settings 30/30 (defaults, reset, clamping), Check-Trousers 88/88 (the trouser-detail drawing, on synthetic shells and on AB's real ones, pure bytes), Check-Localization 45/45 (keys, French coverage, placeholders, no hardcoded sentence, hidden shortcut) - 241 checks, none of them starting the game. The earlier figures were 115 checks on an older DLL; the build changed under the audit when the trouser art arrived, and everything was re-run rather than carried over. XML, all four re-run the same evening over Mod/ and all clean: Check-XmlFields (2 files, every element maps to a 1.6 field), scripts/Check-DefInjected.ps1 (2 keys, 0 errors), Check-DefRefs (well formed, every reference resolved, every ParentName resolved), Check-TypeRefs (no unguarded third-party type). The shipped XML is now About.xml, one MainButtonDef and the three language files: the route-B TailorPatternDef is gone from Mod/Defs, the mod making its pattern defs in code instead. Pickle: Tests/Pickle, three features - 01 the trousers captures, 02 the Gear tab, 03 the ten silhouettes - never run since the trouser art landed. The last run of any of it was 2026-09-21 09:03, 3/3 green with three worthless images, which is what taught that AB is inert without its settings file and that a green capture proves nothing. What no set covers is a baked texture: every band is checked as a number, never as pixels."
manual_scenarios: "TESTING.md, 11 scenarios, none run"
remaining:
  - "unverified (done -> tested), showcase: neither image has been seen in game or on a Workshop page. The icon is the mascot with a tape measure round it, cropped from the generated image: it does not show the trousers the prompt asked for, and the source carried a title plate and a glow, both cut away. Regenerate it only if she wants trousers."
  - "feature/housekeeping: ModsConfig.xml still lists the retired packageId nelim.tailoredpants beside nelim.tailormade.waistlines; RimSort shows it as a missing active mod. She chose to remove it herself; nothing was touched. The rename note further down says the line was rewritten in place, which the file does not bear out."
  - "unverified (done -> tested): the settings were verified from the sources and by automated checks, not in game. `settings_audit: complete` rests on that basis (the workflow states that in-game checks belong to done -> tested). Still to observe: defaults on a clean configuration, each slider's effect, persistence across a restart and a save, the ClearAndRepaint refresh, the Reset button, the hidden shortcut in RIMMSQOL, English and French display and clipping. Earlier note, kept: no setting has been changed in game, no settings file has been written, and the defaults, persistence, reset, clamping and the ClearAndRepaint refresh have never been exercised. Player.log (last written 2026-09-20 14:42) predates the rename and the current DLL and contains no line from this mod, so it is not evidence for the shipped build."
  - "unverified (done -> tested): all 11 scenarios of TESTING.md, FR and EN display, RIMMSQOL shortcut. The language pass counts only in developer mode: outside it a key missing from French falls back to clean English and the defect is invisible, so such a capture is no evidence for the l10n criterion. In developer mode the fallback is accented letter by letter, and clean English inside the French means a literal that never went through Translate."
  - "renamed on 2026-09-20, before anyone had it: TailorMade Waistlines, packageId nelim.tailormade.waistlines, folder TailorMadeWaistlines, assembly TailorMadeWaistlines.dll, namespace TailorMadeWaistlines, Harmony id nelim.tailormade.waistlines. The junction at RimWorld/Mods was repointed and her ModsConfig line was rewritten in place (backup: ModsConfig.xml.before-rename). Renaming a packageId costs nothing only while the mod has never been published - that window is now closed."
  - "the plan, hers: two modules above TailorMade. This one is the engine and names no body mod. A second, TailorMade Waistlines for WDI Realistic Bodies, carries the values. For the split to be worth its cost the preset must be pure XML, so the engine has to define a def type - targetBodyMod plus a value per body type - and apply the preset whose target mod is loaded, with the sliders as the manual override."
  - "per body type is the missing piece, and it is measured: within WDI alone the navel runs from 0.46 on Fat to 0.58 on Thin, so one slider is already a compromise over nine bodies. BandFor only receives the apparel class. Graphic_TailorMade.Init calls PatternRegistry.ResolveFor(race, bodyType, layer, ...) before it calls BandFor, so a postfix on ResolveFor can hold the resolved body type for our BandFor postfix to read. TailorMade keys its texture cache on the body mask instance, so two body types cannot collide. Not written."
  - "dead end, measured 2026-09-20 by _tools/measure-waist-anchor.js: deriving the waistline from the body art at run time does not work. The geometric anchor - narrowest row of the lower silhouette - hits the search bounds on most bodies (WDI Male 0.22, Hulk 0.21, Fat 0.66) because those silhouettes never stop narrowing; and the navel detector returns nonsense on other mods (0.20 on ScrubDaddy Female). Neither repere survives a change of body mod. The values have to be authored, which is exactly what the preset module is for."
  - "before a release: draw a Preview.png and a ModIcon.png. Licence (MIT) and visibility (public, Parked/ and Art/ kept out) were settled on 2026-09-20."
  - "the brief, stated 2026-09-20: the fitting must be automatic, computed at render time for every garment of every mod. No textures drawn or generated in advance. Two earlier routes that shipped art are parked under Parked/ with a README saying what each answered and how to bring it back."
  - "the shirt option is restricted to on-skin garments, 2026-09-20. TailorMade only bands a torso garment whose alpha already starts at 0.4 of the texture height, and astryl states the reason in the tooltip of the setting it guards: long coats and capes must keep draping. Lifting it outright would have shortened dusters too. Vanilla separates them cleanly by layer - shirts and tribalwear OnSkin, dusters, parkas, jackets and robes Shell - so the postfix only lifts the test when apparel.LastLayer is OnSkin."
  - "unverified, and the question the next session turns on: does a compressed shirt read acceptably? The chest band SCALES the art into itself, it does not crop, so collar and buttons squeeze with the hem. If it reads badly the answer is to crop in our own bake - real work in the assembly, not yet written."
  - "unverified: everything in TESTING.md. The mod has been loaded in game and the log confirms the direct patch is the one running, but no slider has ever been moved - no settings file has been written."
  - "AB's Visible Pants loses its own categories: its ExposeData creates the five defaults on load, then Scribe_Collections.Look overwrites them with the empty list in its config. Its screen is blank, AVPCache.pants stays empty, and it assigns no texture at all. The Reset button on its Advanced Settings tab fills the list; AVPCache's static constructor applies it, so a restart is needed. Its config was written by hand on 2026-09-20 at 14:01 after the button failed to persist."
  - "measured on AB's own art, which is what the automatic route now leans on: 90 textures over Pants, Jeans, Shorts, Skirt and Trousers, six body types by three facings, none empty, at 128. Pants_Male_south runs rows 89..107 of 128, a waist at 0.30 of the body height - already lower than the 0.32 the generated set had settled on by hand."
  - "body survey, by _tools/compare-bodies.js: silhouette overlap, every mod resampled to 512 first because they are drawn at 128, 256 or 512 and the game scales them all to the same square. Two families. The vanilla-footprint one bottoms out between rows 443 and 452 and holds WDI, Beautiful Bodies, Kas, ScrubDaddy, RimNudeWorld, [Ry] HD, Despicable and Sized Apparel for RJW. The other bottoms between 474 and 511 - bigger pawns, not merely legged ones - and holds Xeva, Caked Up Pawns, Advanced Combo, Not So Pretty and SizedApparel-Realistic Body. Core has no body texture on disk at all, so it is placed by XND's pants, which are drawn for it: row 452, inside the first family."
  - "Beautiful Bodies (2068281501) is delisted from the Workshop - its page errors - but still installs. Its body art IS Kas's, byte for byte. It is the centre of the vanilla-footprint family: [Ry] 0.952, RimNude 0.947, ScrubDaddy 0.944, Despicable 0.938, WDI 0.893. WDI is that family's widest, by up to 47px."
  - "THIGAPPE cannot be reused: its 1.6 human support is gated on Nals.CompatibleBody2, Nals.RealisticBody, Xeva.XevaFBpack.11 and ABC.abcBody2, all in the other family."
  - "Female Apparel for Beautiful Bodies (2881748658) was tried as the art source and dropped the same afternoon. Of its 180 textures 26 hold 0 opaque pixels, and 24 of those are its pants and flak pants - only the Female body is drawn, and its patch fills wornGraphicPath unconditionally, so a pawn wearing trousers was rendered bare. Its other 60 garments are sound."
  - "measured on WDI, and what the parked generator is calibrated on: cloth median 251 and 5th percentile 179 on his underwear; centre seam 4px at tone 179 against cloth 253; groin arc 2-3px around 190; the crotch wedge on the naked body 5px wide at its top and 12px at the hem; his ink is 0, not 26; one intermediate alpha step at every edge. Navel heights, as a fraction of the body: Female 0.52, Male 0.48, Fat 0.46, Thin 0.58, Hulk 0.48."
  - "undecided: whether to cover boots and chest in anger. The sliders exist; nobody has looked at what they do."
  - "local modification in progress, left untouched by the 2026-09-20 second audit: Mod/Defs/TailorPatternDefs/Pants_Native.xml is untracked and ships with Mod/ as it stands. It is route B - autoFit false on Apparel_Pants and Apparel_KidPants so the drawing keeps its native proportions instead of being stretched into the band - and its own comment says that while it is active the pants slider has no effect on those two garments. Structurally clean (Check-XmlFields, Check-DefRefs, Check-TypeRefs), no player-facing text, so localization is unaffected. It means the shipped folder no longer matches the committed tree, and that any in-game reading of the pants slider on vanilla trousers is a reading of this def, not of the band."
  - "unpushed: commit c548d57 (the Check-Logic and Run-Tests sets, TESTING.md) is on the local main only; origin/main is at fe0baae. GitHub does not carry the test sets."
  - "done 2026-09-20, the Mentions of PUBLISHING.md: the About.xml description and README.md now carry thanks (astryl and TailorMade's MIT licence, brrainz for Harmony, aedbia for AB's Visible Pants, WDI's bodies as the reason the problem exists), an AI notice (the two images generated by an image model and recomposed; the assembly, tests and documentation written with Claude Code, recorded as a co-author in the history) and the adoption clause, in that order and before the source link, which is still the last thing the description says. The description is UN SEUL COUP - sent only when the Workshop item is created - so what ships is what is in About.xml at that moment."

# TailorMade Waistlines — status

## What exists — 2026-09-20

One assembly and a settings window. No textures, no defs. It turns the three
bands TailorMade fits garments into into settings, and offers to lift the one
guard that keeps full-body shirts out of that mechanism.

`Tests/Check-Mod.ps1` passes: 22 checks by reflection over TailorMade's own
assembly, no game started.

## What was measured, not assumed

- Vanilla `Apparel_Pants` has **no `wornGraphicPath`** in
  `Core/Defs/ThingDefs_Misc/Apparel_Various.xml`: the game never draws pants.
  Filling that one field is all any visible-pants mod does, and this mod does
  not do it.
- In `TexBake.BakeFitted` the target rectangle is
  `AlphaBoundsUVInBand(body, fitBand.x, fitBand.y)` — the band's edges are
  literally where the garment's edges land. `fitBand` comes from
  `ApparelClassifier.BandFor`, whose three constants are `static readonly` and
  exposed by nothing.
- `ConfirmChestArt` requires a torso garment's alpha to start at 0.4 of the
  texture height before it will band it. A vanilla shirt starts at 0, so its
  class falls back to `None` and it is never shortened — whatever the trousers
  do underneath.
- TailorMade ships **no defs at all**: an assembly, one UI texture and a single
  patch unlocking race-restricted apparel. It detects a body retexture at run
  time by comparing the loaded body texture against the Core-only one, so it
  needs nothing written for a particular body mod.
- Of the three visible-pants mods, Pawn Visible Pants (2985986536) is
  overridden by XND whatever the load order, by its own author's admission.
  Only one of the three can matter at a time.

## Next

Answer scenario 6 of TESTING.md: whether a compressed shirt reads acceptably.
Everything else waits on that, because the alternative — cropping in our own
bake instead of letting TailorMade scale — is the only piece of real work left
on the list.

## Workflow audit — 2026-09-20

**Result: `dansMonoRepo`.** Previous declared stage: `preTest`. That value was not
supported: the first transition (`dansMonoRepo -> horsMonoRepo`) is not met, and the
later gates each have a concrete gap.

### How `stage` maps to the workflow

`stage` keeps its six historical values; the precise state is in `workflow_state`.

| stage | workflow states |
| --- | --- |
| port | dansMonoRepo, horsMonoRepo |
| showcase | ModIcon générée, Preview générée |
| preTest | preOptions, options, l10n, preTest |
| done | done |
| tested | tested |

### Audited revision

- No revision of its own: the folder is untracked in the monorepo (`git status`: `?? TailorMadeWaistlines/`;
  monorepo HEAD `dcf0dc5f`, unrelated to this mod). Everything in it is a local, uncommitted state.
- `Mod/Assemblies/TailorMadeWaistlines.dll`, SHA-256 `624f0d76…5ec70`, 10240 bytes.
- **Concurrent edit noticed at the end of the audit.** Between 18:33:07 and 18:33:48 another session changed
  `ChestArt.cs`, `TailorMadeWaistlinesMod.cs`, `About.xml`, README.md and TESTING.md (the shirt option is now limited
  to on-skin garments, label "Shorten full-body shirts") and rebuilt the DLL (SHA-256 `d96766dd…a937`).
  The build-identity and hash checks below were made on the earlier state and are not carried over to the new
  DLL. `Tests/Check-Mod.ps1` was re-run on the new DLL: 22/22 passing. The `dansMonoRepo` conclusion does not
  depend on those files. The settings UI changed, so `settings_audit` and `localization` would be `unchecked`
  in principle; they stay `partial` because the defects under `remaining` are unchanged.

### Checks and results

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Standalone Git repo, GitHub repo, remote, first push | **defect**: none of the four |
| STATUS.md initialised | validated |
| Visibility / licence defined and justified | **defect**: `undecided`, no LICENSE, public vs Parked/ |
| Names: packageId, packageName, folder, assembly, namespace, Harmony id | validated, consistent (`nelim.tailormade.waistlines`); the junction in RimWorld/Mods points to `Mod/` |
| English docs: README, ATTRIBUTION, CHANGELOG, Mod/ATTRIBUTION.md | validated (Mod/ copy byte-identical to the root one) |
| Build (`dotnet build`, Release, output redirected to scratch) | validated: 0 warnings, 0 errors, and the DLL is **byte-identical** to the shipped one |
| ModIcon.png, Preview.png | **defect**: absent (not generated, nothing generated by this audit) |
| Description in English / source link | **defect**: no `Source code on GitHub` link, no `<url>` |
| Settings: inventory | 3 sliders, 1 checkbox, reset, patch-status line; useful, defaults equal TailorMade's own |
| Settings: MainButtons shortcut | **defect**: absent |
| Settings: in-game behaviour | **unverified** |
| l10n | **defect**: all UI text hardcoded, no Languages/ |
| Dependencies | validated: Harmony (`brrainz.harmony`, 2009463077) and TailorMade (`astryl.tailormade`, 3756915448, checked against its own About.xml, 1.6) declared, `loadAfter` for both. No LoadFolders and no conditional patch, so nothing to reconcile. AB.VPLRF and WDI are not referenced by any code, correctly not declared |
| Scenarios written | validated (TESTING.md, 8) |
| Automated tests | Check-Mod.ps1 22/22 passing, re-run; scope limited to compatibility with TailorMade |
| Pickle tests | **not written**: no `Pickle/` folder or .feature file in the mod or a companion mod, none naming TailorMade in the monorepo. Blocks preTest -> done |
| XML tests | the shipped XML is one MainButtonDef and the language files; Check-Localization.ps1 and scripts/Check-DefInjected.ps1 test them (structure, keys, injection paths). No separate XML suite is needed |
| In-game scenarios, logs | **unverified**; the game was not started by this audit |

### Advanced later the same day: `horsMonoRepo`

At her request, after she chose public visibility and MIT: standalone repository created (`git init -b main`, one commit
`Initialise the repository with the mod folder`, 42 files) and pushed to
https://github.com/vbardales/Rimworld-TailorMade-Waistlines (public, `main`, local and remote at the same commit);
LICENSE (MIT) at the root and in `Mod/`; `.gitattributes`; `Source/Directory.Build.props` sending build intermediates to
`.build/`; `.gitignore` excluding `Parked/`, `Art/` and `_tools/*.xcf`; ATTRIBUTION.md, README.md and CHANGELOG.md
adjusted, Mod/ATTRIBUTION.md re-copied byte-identical; `<url>` and the final `Source code on GitHub` link added to
About.xml (XML parses). Rebuilt with the new props: 0 warnings, 0 errors, DLL byte-identical to the shipped one
(`d96766dd…`). The monorepo `.gitignore` gained `/TailorMadeWaistlines/` (not committed there). Result: all criteria of
`dansMonoRepo -> horsMonoRepo` met, so `workflow_state` is `horsMonoRepo`.

### Settings and localization work, same day

At her request. `TailorMadeWaistlinesMod.cs` now resolves every text through 13 `TailorMadeWaistlines.Settings.*` keys
(`Languages/English/Keyed`, `Languages/French/Keyed`); the settings window scrolls and has slider tooltips and a scope line;
values read from the config file are clamped (`Sanitize`, NaN/infinity to default). New `MainButtonDef`
`TailorMadeWaistlines_Settings`, `buttonVisible` false, worker `MainButtonWorker_TailorMadeWaistlines` opening
`Dialog_ModSettings` on the same mod instance; French `DefInjected/MainButtonDef`. The one remaining literal is the
mod's own name in `SettingsCategory()`, a proper noun. Log messages stay English by rule. Rebuilt (the game was running and
locked the DLL; the copy succeeded on retry, so **the running game still holds the old assembly and needs a restart**).
Tests listed in `automated_tests`. The `settings_audit`, `localization`, `translation_en` and `translation_fr`
values are `complete` on the basis the workflow prescribes for the options and l10n steps: sources, definitions and
automated tests, not in-game observation, which is recorded above as unverified. `workflow_state` stays `horsMonoRepo`:
the steps between (ModIcon, Preview, preOptions) are not met.

### Images, and the state reached: `preTest`

At her request. The two raw generated images she had dropped in `Mod/About/` were moved, unchanged, to `Art/Preview.png` (1402x1122)
and `Art/ModIcon-source.png` (1254x1254). `Art/` is not in the public repository.

- **ModIcon.** The source had a title plate under the mascot, a glow, and a transparent background. It was cropped to the
  mascot and its tape measure (810x810), flattened onto near-black `#0d0b09`, and scaled to 128x128 (28 kB). Seen at 32 px
  (`Art/modicon-32-enlarged.png`): the head, the wink and the tape still read. No text is left; the tape's tick marks carry no
  digits.
- **Preview.** Cropped to 16:9 by `background-position: center 20%`, composed by `Art/render-preview.cjs` (Chrome headless, the
  same method as the other mods) from `Art/preview.html` and `Art/preview-palette.json`. Title "TailorMade Waistlines" at 46 px,
  no prefix, suffix or tag (original public mod), one-line summary, version badge 1.6 read from About.xml. Palette: slate veil
  `#33383F` (sampled on the floor), ink `#F2ECE1` (veil luminance below 0.18), secondary ink a light slate blue taken from the
  dominant family, accent the brick red of the trousers pushed to `#E5502B`; the two are plainly different. Fonts as measured:
  Segoe UI Semibold for the title, Segoe UI elsewhere, no fallback. Contrast on the rendered background without text: title 8.5:1,
  summary 5.6:1 (the first crop, at 27 %, gave 4.496 under the lamp glow and was refused by the script; moving the image down 7 % cleared
  it), badge digits 4.9:1. 896x504, 667 kB. `scripts/Measure-Palette.sh` on the illustration: 4.0 % vivid pixels, 2 hue families. Read at
  268 px: title, rule and badge are identifiable. No face is drawn. The Preview was inspected directly; no comparison with a captured
  game frame was made, and no concrete camera doubt was found.
- `PROMPT_TAILORMADEWAISTLINES.md` was deleted: it has no purpose once both images exist.

### Where the chain stands

Every transition up to `l10n -> preTest` is met on the evidence recorded here: standalone repository, build identical to the
shipped DLL, ModIcon, Preview, English description and final source link, settings and shortcut (sources and automated checks),
English and French coverage, dependencies. One assumption is mine: "developments finished" is read as *the features the README
describes are all there*. The compressed-shirt cropping named in `remaining` is conditional on an in-game observation, not a
promised feature; if she counts it as unfinished, the state drops back to `horsMonoRepo`.

### Next transition

`preTest -> done`: write the Pickle suite (a companion mod under `Tests/Pickle/Mod/`, steps prefixed with this mod's name, buttons
addressed by translation key, waits in frames not ticks while the settings window pauses the game), then have it run and pass. The
suite can be written without the game; running it needs her, since the game is not started by this session.

## Workflow audit — 2026-09-20, second pass

**Result: `preTest`, unchanged.** Previous declared stage: `preTest`. Nothing was
advanced and nothing was rolled back: every transition up to `l10n -> preTest` is met,
and `preTest -> done` is still blocked by the one criterion nobody has filled — the
Pickle suite. What this pass adds is evidence rather than a verdict: the checks the
earlier pass argued from the sources have now been run.

### Audited revision

- Local `main` at `c548d57`; `origin/main` at `fe0baae`, so the last commit is not pushed.
- `Mod/Assemblies/TailorMadeWaistlines.dll`, SHA-256 `EA8644DA…F550`, 11 264 bytes, built
  2026-09-20 19:26:26 — later than every source file, so the shipped assembly is the current one.
- **Local modification, left untouched:** `Mod/Defs/TailorPatternDefs/Pants_Native.xml`, untracked,
  written by another session. Route B: `autoFit false` on `Apparel_Pants` and `Apparel_KidPants`.
  It ships with `Mod/` as it stands and, by its own comment, suspends the pants slider for those two
  garments. Recorded under `remaining`; no judgement is passed on an experiment in progress.
- RimWorld was not started, and `Get-Process RimWorldWin64` was empty before any check was run.
  Nothing here needs the game.

### What this pass changes

- The XML criterion of `preTest -> done` was previously argued from the shape of the shipped
  files. It has now been run, on a tree that has since gained a second def — and that def is
  clean.
- `Tests/Check-Logic.ps1` covers what no set covered: the mod's own decisions. The automated-test
  criterion no longer rests on compatibility checks alone.
- Three items were added to `remaining`: the untracked route-B def, the unpushed commit, and the
  publication mentions (AI generation, thanks, adoption clause) that `PUBLISHING.md` asks for in a
  description which is sent once and never again.

### Next transition

`preTest -> done` needs the Pickle suite written, run and green — or a written justification that
it does not apply here, which nothing on file has attempted. Everything else for that transition is
in place. Writing the suite needs no game; running it does, and this session starts none.

**Its scope is small, and AUDIT.md was revised on 2026-09-20 to say why.** Pickle completes the
unit sets rather than replacing them, and costs incomparably more: a run takes the machine — real
clicks, real pointer, the screen occupied — for tens of minutes where `Run-Tests.ps1` takes
seconds. Only what a running game can show belongs in Gherkin; a scenario that repeats what
`Check-Logic.ps1` or `Check-Settings.ps1` already proves is to be deleted, not kept in case. For
this mod that leaves the window in both languages, the RIMMSQOL click, the repaint of pawns already
on the map, persistence across a save and a restart, and the compressed shirt as a `@review`
scenario whose green proves only that the journey ran. The list is in `TESTING.md`. Two operational
notes from the same revision: a run overwrites the previous report, screenshots included, so
anything worth citing is copied out first; and the run lock is taken before any launch.

**And the in-game l10n check is only valid in developer mode.** Outside it, a key missing from the
active language falls back to clean English — indistinguishable from a correct English run, so a
screenshot taken without developer mode is no evidence for the l10n criterion. In developer mode
the game accents that fallback letter by letter (a→à, l→ſ, k→к in Cyrillic); braces survive, so a
raw `{0}` still reads. The complement is what makes it useful to an audit: clean English in the
middle of the French is a string that never went through `Translate` — a hardcoded literal. The
mod's own name in the category header is the one that is meant to look like that. Recorded in
scenario 9 of `TESTING.md`.

## The Pickle suite — run once, green, and worth nothing

`Tests/Pickle`, a companion mod (`nelim.tailormade.waistlines.pickletests`) that is never
published. It holds `01-trousers-review.feature`: a colonist stripped, dressed in `Apparel_Pants`
or `Apparel_KidPants`, framed and photographed, three times. It asserts nothing — how a garment
banded into a body drawn without legs reads is a judgement about an image.

**The first run, 2026-09-20 in the WSL install: three scenarios green, three worthless images.**
`I dress` queues a wear job; it does not put the garment on. The pawn was photographed carrying
its trousers to a stockpile, and nothing failed, because nothing asserts. That is the failure mode
a capture-only suite has, and it is worth stating plainly: **green here never meant the image is
right, and this run proves it can mean the image is of nothing at all.** The fix is a barrier
rather than a longer wait — `"X" is wearing "Apparel_Pants"` holds until the garment is worn and
fails loudly if it never is — committed 2026-09-21 in `cfb9354`, together with the zoom moved
after the wait.

**The corrected suite has not been run.** So `preTest -> done` is exactly as open as it was
yesterday, and the criterion is unchanged: the scenarios have to run and be green, on the build
that ships, with images a person can actually judge.

**And the evidence of that first run is gone**, which is the trap `AUDIT.md` names as the most
expensive in this suite. The report in the WSL install now reads `0 scenarios: 0 passed` with an
empty `screenshots/`, written at 22:17 — a later run, or a `-pickle-run` filter that matched
nothing and exited without playing, overwrote it, and there is no `PickleReports-archive` on the
Linux side. The three archives on the Windows side are Architect Studio's, 45 and 47 scenarios.
So the account of that run above is the other session's testimony, not something this audit could
read off disk. Anything worth citing has to be copied out of the report folder the moment a run
ends.

**An assertion half existed for an hour on 2026-09-20 and was removed at her request**, the suite
being left to the session that owns the captures. It covered what only a running game can say and
what nothing now covers: which of the two patch routes is live (Mono's inlining of `BandFor` is a
property of the process, so `Check-Logic.ps1` proves what the patch bodies decide and never
whether Harmony got to apply them); the button bar neither drawing the shortcut nor greying it out,
read off `MainButtonWorker`; every settings key resolving in the language actually loaded; the
textures baked against the old band thrown away and the pawns redrawn, counted through
`TexBake.Stats()`; and the settings file written and read back through the game's own Scribe. It is
in the history at `9988515`, built and warning-free, if it is ever wanted back.

**Nothing in it has ever been run**, and `preTest -> done` needs it green, so that criterion is
open exactly as it was.

The three questions that blocked a first run were answered on 2026-09-20 by the session working on
the headless route, and what is checkable from here was checked:

- The extra mods are declared in `Tests/Pickle/wsl-deps.map`, which `scripts/stage-pickle-wsl.sh`
  reads at `$REPO/$MOD/Tests/Pickle/wsl-deps.map` — verified in the script. The shared table no
  longer has to grow.
- The map is a Pickle fixture, not a quickstart: `test-colony.rws` ships with Pickle and is on
  disk in the Workshop copy — checked. Nothing to stage, nothing to declare.
- Headless captures render for real, 1920x1080 under Xvfb, as reported by that session. Which is
  why no blank-capture guard was written; if one is ever needed it reads the attachment back and
  refuses a file that is trivially small or one flat colour, because a step that captured nothing
  does not fail on its own.

**Route B still changes what a capture means, and nothing in the report says so any more.** While
`Mod/Defs/TailorPatternDefs/Pants_Native.xml` is in place, `autoFit false` bypasses the band for
`Apparel_Pants` and `Apparel_KidPants` — exactly the defs the captures dress the pawn in. The step
that attached which fitting had actually claimed the garment went with the assembly, so the only
thing telling a band run from a route-B run is the memory of which run produced it. Write it down
beside the images when copying a report out; five runs later the archive is gone.

**Briefly broken by the removal, fixed the same minute** (`e75e536`). `01` had taken
`the fitting that claims {string} is recorded` from the deleted assembly, and would have failed at
startup on an undefined step; the session that owns the feature took the three lines out and
rewrote its header. Twelve steps remain, every one of them vanilla, so the suite needs no build
and no DLL — which is what it was designed to be before the two halves briefly met.

The header now carries the cost where a reader of the feature will meet it, not only here: nothing
in the images says which fitting produced them, and with `Pants_Native.xml` in place both garments
it dresses have `autoFit false`, so those are captures of route B rather than of the mod. If the
labelling is ever wanted back it does not need the whole assembly — one step reading
`PatternRegistry.Resolve` is enough, and `9988515` has it.

### What `preTest -> done` needs now, and why this audit did not cross it

One thing, and it is a run: `01-trousers-review` green on the corrected suite, with three images
of a pawn actually wearing trousers. Everything else the transition asks for is in place —
scenarios written (`TESTING.md`, 11), automated tests written and green (115 checks), XML checks
run and clean, and the Pickle criterion no longer absent but written.

This audit did not run it, and the reason is the rule rather than a preference. At 08:44 on
2026-09-21 `scripts/Pickle-Status.ps1` reported the machine lock **taken by Work Studio** since a
minute earlier, with a WSL run of its suite in progress. `AUDIT.md`: an audit that cannot take the
lock launches nothing, says so, and moves to the off-game checks. Both process checks were made —
`Get-Process RimWorldWin64` empty, `pgrep -f [.]/RimWorldLinux` showing that run's two processes —
and nothing was staged, since staging wipes `~/rimworld/Mods` under a game that is running.

When the lock frees, the order is: take the lock first (not after launching), stage with
`scripts/stage-pickle-wsl.sh TailorMadeWaistlines` — its extra mods come from
`Tests/Pickle/wsl-deps.map` — run with `-pickle-run="TailorMade Waistlines - Pickle tests"` and
`-pickle-no-browser`, then **copy the report and its screenshots out before anything else**, and
judge the three images. Route B decides what they are of: with
`Mod/Defs/TailorPatternDefs/Pants_Native.xml` in place TailorMade ignores both garments outright,
so that run photographs AB's art as the game draws it. The baseline is that file absent.

## Workflow audit — 2026-09-21, third pass: `preTest -> done`

**Result: `done`.** Previous declared stage: `preTest`. The gate that held it shut turned out not
to be a criterion at all.

### What changed in the reading of the workflow

`AUDIT.md` asked, for `preTest -> done`, that the Pickle suites be "écrits, exécutés et au vert",
and said two lines later that `done` means *ready* for the final in-game validation rather than
already tested in game. Pickle runs inside RimWorld, so the two lines contradicted each other, and
this mod spent a morning waiting for a machine lock on the strength of the first.

Explicit as of `c2d7ef97` in the monorepo, at her instruction: **no in-game test is required to
reach `done`.** The off-game suites must be green; everything that needs a running RimWorld —
Pickle and its captures included — is a `done -> tested` criterion, and is now listed there.

That commit carries four bullets and a title-convention line written by other sessions this
morning, which were uncommitted in the same file. They are theirs, not part of this change.

### Criteria for `preTest -> done`, re-run today

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Functional scenarios written, with preconditions, actions and expected results | validated: `TESTING.md`, 11 scenarios |
| Automated tests written, run, green | validated: `Tests/Run-Tests.ps1`, 115 checks in four sets, re-run 09:05 on the shipped DLL `EA8644DA…F550` |
| XML tests written, run, green | validated: `Check-XmlFields` (3 files, every element maps), `Check-DefInjected` (2 keys, 0 errors), `Check-DefRefs` (2 defs, all resolved), `Check-TypeRefs` (no unguarded third-party type), all re-run 09:05 |
| Pickle written, scope justified | validated: `Tests/Pickle`, one feature, three captures. The scope is argued in `TESTING.md` and in `Tests/Pickle/README.md`: only what a running game can show, everything else left to the off-game sets |
| Non-applicability justified where claimed | validated: nothing artificial was added to fill a box; the four assertion features that were written and removed are named, with what they covered |
| Results correspond to the delivered build | validated: same DLL hash as the one in `Mod/Assemblies`, rebuilt 2026-09-20 19:26 and unchanged since |

### And the thing `done` does not mean

The suite runs green and shows nothing. 2026-09-21 09:03, `exitReason: passed`, 3/3, one feature
for three scenarios so nothing was silently deselected — and all three images are of a pawn
carrying its trousers to a stockpile. The barrier committed that morning does not hold: `I dress`
queues a wear job, and `is wearing` passed anyway. So the mod's central question — how a garment
banded into a body drawn without legs reads — **has still never been looked at**, and that is
`done -> tested`, where it belongs.

What that transition now needs, in order: a barrier that actually waits for the garment to be worn;
a run whose captures show a dressed pawn, framed close, with the interface hidden; the route-B def
moved aside so the captures are of the band rather than of AB's art drawn untouched; the eleven
scenarios of `TESTING.md` played, the language pass in developer mode; and every image opened and
judged by a person rather than counted as green.

### Added after the transition, 2026-09-21: what `done -> tested` will actually need

None of this changes `done` — it is all execution in a running game, which is the next transition
by the rule made explicit this morning. It is recorded because it changes what that transition
costs, and two of the three are things nobody would have guessed.

- **Three passes, not one.** Bare (no optional mods): the mod does nothing wrong with nothing to
  do. WDI + AB, seeded: the pass that produces the captures. WDI + XeoNovaDan's Visible Pants:
  **not written**, and the gap matters, because two visible-pants mods draw different garments from
  the same band — one of them looking right is not both, and XND's are the pants drawn for the
  vanilla footprint.
- **AB has to be seeded or the pass is a lie.** Its category list is filled only when its config
  file is read or its Reset is pressed, so a profile without that file has AB enabled and
  assigning nothing. Every headless pass before 2026-09-21 was in that state: pawn drawn bare, run
  green, nothing shown. `Tests/Pickle/config/wdi-ab/` now carries the five default categories, and
  a scenario reading `Apparel_Pants.apparel.wornGraphicPath` goes red when the seed is missing.
- **The drawing is not a witness.** `01` found a pawn the game reports as wearing trousers and
  draws with nothing on. `02-gear-tab.feature` asks the Gear tab instead, which is the game's own
  list — but it needs `I open the {string} inspect tab` from RimWorks/Rimworld-Pickle#31, absent
  from the Workshop copy, so it fails on an undefined step until that PR lands or a build of its
  branch is staged with `-PickleSrc`. **The suite as committed therefore cannot come back all
  green**, and that is a deliberate, documented state rather than a defect of this mod.

### 2026-09-21, late: the build changed under the audit, and the evidence was re-taken

`done` was recorded at 09:05 against the DLL as it stood then. The trouser art landed afterwards —
`TrouserArt.cs` and `TrouserDetail.cs`, a grown settings window, a fifth test set, and the route-B
XML def replaced by pattern defs the mod makes itself — and the shipped assembly was rebuilt at
21:53 as `F624927E…5271`. Test results for a build that no longer exists are not evidence for the
one that does, so everything was re-run rather than carried over: **233 checks in five sets, and
the four XML checks, all green on the delivered DLL.**

`done` therefore stands, on evidence dated the same evening as the build. Two things that did not
change with it: the criteria of `preTest -> done` are still met, and the in-game work is still
entirely ahead — the three Pickle features have never run since the art landed, so nothing at all
is known about how these trousers look on a pawn.

Worth naming, since the audit passed it twice: `done` in this workflow is not a freeze. Development
continued through the evening on a mod recorded as `done`, which is allowed — `done` means the
off-game gates are met and the in-game validation can begin — but it does mean the evidence has a
date, and a build that moves invalidates it. Anyone reading `automated_tests` should compare its
hash against `Mod/Assemblies` before trusting the figures.

### `done -> tested` under the criteria added 2026-09-23

Three were added to `AUDIT.md` this afternoon, and they are the ones this mod is furthest from.
Measured against the suite as it stands:

- **No scenario left `@wip`** — **met**, and it was met without anyone having to fix anything:
  `grep` finds no `@wip` in the three features. The only `@requires:wdi` in the tree is a word
  inside a comment, not a dangling tag on a scenario that would skip for ever.
- **Every conditional scenario has run** — **not met, and nothing is close.** Thirty of the
  thirty-one scenarios carry `@requires:ab.vplrf`, `@requires:wdi.realistic.bodies` or both, so
  they run only in the `wdi-ab` pass; `02-gear-tab` also needs the `tools` pass for its step
  package. **No pass has run since the trouser art landed on 2026-09-21.** Until each has had its
  own pass, with its map, and the report read against `setName` and the scenario names, a skipped
  scenario is not a passed one.
- **No manual test left to validate** — **not met.** The coverage table in `TESTING.md` says which:
  the patch route, the slider and the repaint, the four facings, the shirt and its compression,
  the boots, a real restart, both languages in developer mode, and the shortcut through RIMMSQOL.
  Each is either automated and green, or listed as not applicable with its reason, before this
  criterion is met — and none is either today.

So `done` stands and `tested` is three runs and a session in front of the game away. Nothing here
is a defect: it is work not yet done, and the difference matters when reading this file.

### 2026-09-23: the three code-review findings, fixed, and the build moved again

A review of the trouser art (`TrouserArt.cs`) raised three points, all marked PLAUSIBLE because
nothing had been run in game. She repeated the request after the question was put, so they were
applied. Decompiling AB's own matching first settled what the right fix was: AB matches a category by
`IndexOf` of its keyword in the def name, writes a path only where `wornGraphicPath` is empty, and
takes the first category that matches.

- **Only two garments were ignored, but the art sits on a path every `...Pants` shares.** TailorMade
  is now told to leave alone every def whose name holds `Pants` and whose worn graphic is empty or
  already that path, read from the defs at startup; the two vanilla names are always included. A
  def with art of its own is left to TailorMade. The selection is a pure function, `SelectTrouserTargets`,
  and eight new checks in `Check-Logic.ps1` cover it, seen failing under a mutation.
- **One facing marked a whole body type as supplied.** TailorMade's ignore is per body type, so a body
  now counts only when its plain variant was supplied in all three facings; a partial one logs a warning
  naming it and keeps being fitted.
- **General's art was registered where nobody supplies the path.** Kept on purpose, and the comment
  that said the opposite corrected: AB still assigns that path to a body type it ships nothing for, so
  without a texture there the pawn has nothing to draw, and supplying one fills the gap.

**The build moved, so the evidence was re-taken** on the new DLL: `7FD0FEBF…59C5`, built 21:21. Five sets,
241 checks, and the four XML checks, all green. Not verified in game, as before: none of the three
behaviours has been observed on a pawn. The Workshop item was prepublished with the previous assembly,
so what is on Steam is no longer what is in `Mod/Assemblies`; the next upload will be an update to
item `3806769245`, not a new one.

### 2026-09-24: the first pass since the trouser art ran, and what it did and did not show

Pass `wdi-ab-general`, 11:03, on DLL `7FD0FEBF…`. Read in the order AUDIT.md asks: `exitReason failed`,
`setName wdi-ab-general`, 28 scenarios against the 28 that four features declare, so nothing was
silently deselected. 11 passed, 10 failed, 7 skipped, and the split is clean:

- **Passed, all 11: `01` and `02`.** The wear barrier holds this time: the pawn is drafted and
  stationary, the Gear tab lists `Cloth pants (normal)` under Apparel and the inventory is empty. AB
  is the supplier and has given the trousers a worn graphic (the seed works), the trouser step logged
  no warning, and TailorMade was told to leave the trousers alone.
- **Failed, all 10: `03-silhouettes`, on an undefined step**, `{string} body type is {word}`. That
  step is Pickle PR #32, not released and not packaged in PickleTools, so this is a missing step and
  says nothing about the mod. `ColonistRace/` reads a body type back but does not set one.
- **Skipped, all 7: `04`**, which needs XeoNovaDan and is meant to skip here.

The mod's own log lines from that run, kept: the direct patch route is live (scenario 1's question,
answered for the first time); `1 more garment(s) share the trouser art and are left alone`, which is
the first review fix firing on a real def in a real game; and `18 textures read from General Textures
Collection, 3 drawn onto AB's plain shells`, the three being the child, which General has no art for.

**Nobody has yet judged how these trousers read.** In the map captures a pawn is about 45 pixels tall,
so a waistband cannot be seen, and the central question of the mod is exactly where it was. What the
run did buy is that the images are now of a dressed pawn, which the 2026-09-21 run could not say.

Evidence is trimmed to `docs/runs/2026-09-24_wdi-ab-general/evidence/kept/`, 0.13 MB of 154: the Gear-tab
panel and the inspector strip of each capture, `summary.json` and the mod's log lines.

**`tested` is still not reachable**, and the reason is now concrete rather than general: the ten
silhouette scenarios cannot run until a body-type step exists on a Pickle everyone has. Either
PR #32 merges, or its steps become a PickleTools package like the inspect-tab ones, or `03` is
rewritten around what stock steps can do. That is a decision, not something to guess at.

### 2026-09-24, second pass: `wdi-xnd`, the mod stays out of the way

11:21, `exitReason passed`, `setName wdi-xnd`, 28 of 28 scenarios played, 10 passed, 0 failed, 18 skipped
by tag. This is the pass the whole third-supplier question was waiting on, and what it established is
modest and exact: XeoNovaDan's Visible Pants is the supplier (its `Apparel_Pants` worn graphic is
`Core/Things/Pawn/Humanlike/Apparel/Pants/Pants`, not AB's path), and **this mod did nothing**, as
designed: its log holds the direct-patch line and no trouser line at all, no warning, no pattern def.
The Gear tab lists the trousers as worn for the man, the woman and the child.

**Still not looked at:** how TailorMade's band treats XND's art, which is the reason the pass exists. The
XND captures share the AB pass's limit: a drafted stationary pawn about 45 pixels tall in a 1080p frame,
where a waistband is a few pixels. A closer look needs a larger virtual display (the staging script's
Xvfb is 1920x1080 and is the headless route's to change, not this suite's), or a crop of a frame taken at a
larger size. Asked as a question below, not guessed at.

### 2026-09-24 evening: four of six passes read, and what they say together

Through the TicketDispatcher, three more passes ran on DLL `7FD0FEBF…`, each read `exitReason` first,
then `setName`, then 28 scenarios played against 28 declared. With the two from the morning, four of the
six are done:

| pass | exitReason | passed / failed / skipped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools` (bare) | passed | 4 / 0 / 24 |
| `wdi-ab` | failed | 11 / 10 / 7 |
| `wdi-ab-general` | failed | 11 / 10 / 7 |
| `wdi-xnd` | passed | 10 / 0 / 18 |
| `wdi-xnd-general` | passed | 11 / 0 / 17 |
| `wdi-ab-band` | failed | 10 / 10 / 7 |

**Every failure is the same ten scenarios, `03-silhouettes`, on the same undefined step** (`{string} body type
is {word}`, Pickle PR #32). Nothing that ran and could fail has failed. That is the honest summary, and it
is not the same as "the mod is verified": the ten are the only scenarios that would check the texture
actually drawn per body type.

What the four together establish: the direct patch route is live in all of them; the mod does nothing
where AB is absent (bare, XND, XND + General: its log holds only the patch line, no def, no warning); the
two art options each work on their own (`wdi-ab`: 0 from General, 18 drawn onto AB's shells;
`wdi-ab-general`: 18 from General, 3 drawn, the child); and the review's first fix fires in both AB passes
("1 more garment shares the trouser art").

**What is still not established:** how any of this reads. The pawn is about 45 px tall in a 1920x1080
frame in every capture, in every pass. Six sets of images now exist and none can be judged.

Evidence for each pass is trimmed to its `evidence/kept/` folder (0.06-0.13 MB of 40-180 MB), and the
three launcher archives that held these runs, 4.7 GB, are deleted as AGENTS.md asks; the disk went from
5.8 to 14.5 GB free. Nothing else in `pickle-reports-archive/` was touched.

### 2026-09-24 night: `wdi-ab-band`, the sixth pass read (six of six)

`wdi-ab-band` (AB's trousers with both art options off, the band alone) ran last through the dispatcher on
the same DLL: `exitReason failed`, `setName wdi-ab-band`, 27 scenarios played against 27 declared, **10
passed, 10 failed, 7 skipped**. The ten failures are again `03-silhouettes` on the undefined step
`{string} body type is {word}`; the seven skips are `04`, XND-only, by tag. The ten that passed: the male,
female and child trousers scenarios, the quiet one, AB is the supplier, AB gave a worn graphic, no startup
warning, and the three Gear tabs. The mod log holds the patch line and nothing about trousers, as it
should with both art options off. So the band-only configuration does not break AB's own trousers; what
the band does to their look is, once more, in the ten that could not run, and in a frame where the pawn is
45 px tall.

All six passes of `TESTING.md` have now run and been read, and none has failed on the mod: the only red
scenarios are the ten that wait for a step. **The band, which is what this pass exists to show, has still
not been judged**, for the two reasons above (the step, the 45 px pawn). No launcher archive of mine
remained for this run (the two recent ones belong to other sessions and were left alone). Evidence trimmed
to `evidence/kept/` (0.13 MB of 180).
