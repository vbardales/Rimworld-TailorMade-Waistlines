# Changelog

## Unreleased

The mod was rebuilt twice before it settled. Only the last shape is loaded; the
two earlier ones are kept locally under `Parked/` (not in this repository) with a README saying what each
answered and how to bring it back.

### The mod as it stands

- The three bands TailorMade fits garments into — pants `(0, 0.58)`, boots
  `(0, 0.20)`, chest `(0.45, 1)` — become settings, through a postfix on
  `ApparelClassifier.BandFor`. This corrects every leg garment of every mod at
  once. The defaults are TailorMade's own values, so installing the mod changes
  nothing until a slider moves.
- A prefix on `TexBake.BakeFitted` does the same job where the band arrives, in
  case Mono inlines the small method above it. It only rewrites a band still
  holding its stock value. A self-test at startup reports in the log which of
  the two is active.
- An option, off by default, lifts `ConfirmChestArt` so that a shirt drawn over
  the whole body counts as a chest piece and can be shortened. The band scales
  the art rather than cropping it, so the shirt is compressed.
- Closing the settings window calls `TailorMadeCache.ClearAndRepaint()`.
- `Tests/Check-Mod.ps1`: 22 checks by reflection over TailorMade's assembly,
  none of which start the game. It catches the way these patches fail — in
  silence — if a method is renamed or a band constant retuned.

### Parked, and why

- **Generated pants.** 27 textures, nine body types by three facings, each cut
  to its body's silhouette by `_tools/make-garment.js --auto`: Kas's garment
  mapped row by row onto WDI's body, waistband at 0.32 of the body's height,
  outline 2px against the body's own 13. With a patch filling `wornGraphicPath`
  on `Apparel_Pants` and `Apparel_KidPants`, and a `TailorPatternDef` telling
  TailorMade to leave both alone. Set aside once the brief became *automatic,
  no retextures*: the fitting must be computed at render time, for every
  garment, not drawn in advance for one.
- **Hand-painted masks.** The first design of all: a mask per body type handed
  to TailorMade in place of the body silhouette, painted in GIMP over a project
  `_tools/gimp-project.scm` builds.

### Measurement tools, kept

`_tools/` holds what the two parked routes were built on, and what settled
several arguments: silhouette overlap between body retextures, where the navel
sits, where a waistband sits, how heavy a drawn outline is. No dependency
beyond Node — `png.js` reads and writes PNG by hand, including greyscale and
16-bit sources, which several body mods turn out to use.
